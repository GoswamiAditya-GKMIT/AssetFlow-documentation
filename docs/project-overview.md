## Problem Statement

Corporate companies often distribute laptops, desktops, monitors, and other IT assets to employees. However, most organizations struggle with:

- **Poor tracking** of which employee has which asset  
- **Manual processes** like Excel sheets or emails  
- **No clear workflow** for handling returns  
- **Difficulty** in monitoring asset availability vs. assigned assets  
- **Inaccurate inventory counts** leading to over-purchasing or shortages  

These issues lead to operational inefficiencies, asset misuse, lack of accountability, and increased workload for IT/admin teams.

## Solution Overview

The **Asset Allocation & Inventory Management System** solves these problems by providing a centralized digital platform where:

- Admins can **manage inventory**, allocate items, and approve asset returns  
- Employees can **view assigned assets** and submit return requests  
- Asset availability and status are updated **in real time**  
- Dashboards offer **quick, clean insights** into inventory and allocations  
- Workflows become **faster, transparent, and easier to audit**

This system replaces manual tracking with a structured solution that improves asset accountability and reduces administrative work.

The system helps IT/admin teams efficiently manage laptops, desktops, monitors, and accessories by tracking inventory, allocations, returns, and asset lifecycle status.
